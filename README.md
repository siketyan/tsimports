# tsimports

âœ¨ A fast and opinionated imports organizer for ECMAScript and TypeScript.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is in alpha stage. Do not use in production. 


## Installation

```shell
npm install -g tsimports
```

> [!TIP]
> If you want to manage the version of tsimports, use `-D` instead of `-g`.


## Usage

### Basic

#### Format a file and write the result to stdout

```shell
tsimports ./src/foo.ts
```

#### Format a file and write in-place

```shell
tsimports --write ./src/foo.ts
```

#### Format all TypeScript files

```shell
tsimports --write ./src/**/*.ts
```

### Advanced

#### Format a stdin input

> [!WARNING]
> tsimports infers the language from the file extension.
> As the standard input has no extension, we cannot infer the language.
> Use `--language` to assume the input is JS, JSX, TS, or TSX.

```shell
cat ./src/foo.ts | tsimports --language ts
```


## The rule

tsimports groups and sorts import statements in the file in a fixed rule.
As tsimports offers you an opinionated rule, you cannot configure any of the rule.


### Groups

tsimports splits the imports into several groups in the following order:

1. Built-in modules (e.g. `node:assert`, `fs`, or `bun`)
2. External modules (e.g. `react`, `@testing-library/react`, or `hono/jwt`)
3. Internal modules (e.g. `~/foo` or `@/foo`, if configured in bundler or somewhere)
4. Parent modules (e.g. `../foo` or `../../foo`)
5. Sibling modules (e.g. `./foo` or `./foo/bar`)
6. Index modules (e.g. `.`, `./`, `./index`, or `./index.js`)


### Ordering

tsimports sorts imports in each group in alphabetical order (case-sensitive).


### Position

tsimports collects all imports at the top of the file.
Any other statements are retained at the position and tsimports doesn't modify anything about them.
